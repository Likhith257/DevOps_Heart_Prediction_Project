# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing key medical and demographic data, this model helps in early identification of individuals at risk for heart disease. This repository contains the data processing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of several classification algorithms to determine the most effective model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains multiple features related to patient health metrics and demographics, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other indicators. The features and target variables are preprocessed for effective model training and testing.

## Algorithms Tested
The project tests multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best model for heart disease prediction, including:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
  ```

## Results

Each algorithm's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The notebook compares the metrics to identify the best-performing model for heart disease prediction.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease. It provides insights into which model performs best on this specific dataset and can be extended to include more advanced models or additional features.
